# Roadmap

- OAuth2 client credentials helper
- Results history in GUI and diffs between runs
- VS Code extension for inline runs and decorations
- HAR import enrichments (query/form/multipart mapping, baseUrl inference)
- gRPC testing (reflect/proto) and contract checks
- Docker image and GitHub Action for CI
- Interactive YAML editing directly in the GUI (edit/save suites with schema hints)
