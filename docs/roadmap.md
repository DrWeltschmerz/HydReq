# Roadmap

Near-term
- Reports in GUI (download JSON/JUnit artifacts)
- Tags filter and default-timeout in GUI header (basic inputs added; refine UX and persistence)
- Editor polish: collapse persistence, Convert… cleanup, DSN helpers per driver docs, “Run with deps” badges
- YAML-preserving save path (optional raw mode with comments/order retained)
- OAuth2 client credentials helper for suite auth

Medium-term
- Results history in GUI and diffs between runs
- VS Code extension for inline runs and decorations
- HAR import enrichments (query/form/multipart mapping, baseUrl inference)
- OpenAPI hints expansion and response schema diffs

Longer-term
- gRPC testing (reflect/proto) and contract checks
- Official Docker image and GitHub Action for CI
