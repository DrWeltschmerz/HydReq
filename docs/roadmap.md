## Near-term (Feasible with Current UI)

### High Priority
- **Reports in GUI (download JSON/JUnit artifacts)** - Essential for CI/CD integration
- **YAML-preserving save path** - Backend-focused, improves user experience

### Medium Priority  
- **OAuth2 client credentials helper** - Common auth pattern, needs some JS
- **Tags filter and default-timeout in GUI header** - UX improvement, needs JS
- **Editor polish** - Various small improvements, needs JS

---

## Medium-term (Requires UI Modernization)

### High Priority
- **Results history in GUI and diffs between runs** - Essential for CI/CD and debugging
- **OpenAPI hints expansion and response schema diffs** - Improves contract testing
- **Advanced reporting: interactive dashboards, trend analysis, performance metrics visualization** - Better insights and monitoring

### Medium Priority
- **AI-assisted test generation: auto-generate tests from OpenAPI specs, suggest assertions** - Major productivity boost
- **Integrations: with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus), issue trackers (Jira, GitHub Issues)** - Enterprise features

---

## New Feature Suggestions

### High Priority
- **API Mocking/Stubbing Engine** - Essential for microservices development workflows
- **Consumer-Driven Contract Testing** - Critical for microservices reliability
- **Plugin Architecture** - Enables community ecosystem and extensibility

### Medium Priority
- **Test Data Factories & Generators** - Reduces test maintenance overhead
- **Multi-Environment Configuration Management** - Essential for complex deployments
- **Performance Regression Detection** - Valuable for CI/CD pipelines

### Low Priority
- **API Documentation Generation** - Nice-to-have for living documentation

---

## Longer-term (Major Infrastructure)

### Medium Priority
- **gRPC testing and contract checks** - Modern protocol support
- **GraphQL support** - Popular query language
- **Official Docker image and GitHub Action** - Deployment and CI automation

### Low Priority
- **Performance testing: load testing, stress testing** - Advanced testing capabilities
- **Security testing** - Basic vulnerability scanning
- **Collaboration features** - Team sharing and version control
- **Mobile API testing** - Platform-specific testing
- **Message queue testing** - Event-driven system testing

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: UI Modernization (Prerequisite)
**Goal**: Enable advanced UI features
**Approach**: HTMX + Alpine.js for progressive enhancement, or full SPA migration
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks
**Dependencies**: None

### Phase 2: High-Impact Features (Post-UI Upgrade)
**Priority Order**:
1. Results history and diffs (CI/CD essential)
2. Advanced reporting dashboards (monitoring)
3. OpenAPI hints expansion (contract testing)
4. API mocking/stubbing (development workflow)
5. Consumer-driven contracts (microservices)
6. Plugin architecture (ecosystem)

### Phase 3: Ecosystem & Integrations
**Focus**: Community plugins, CI/CD integrations, enterprise features
**Timeline**: Ongoing after Phase 2

---

## Success Metrics

### Near-term Goals (3-6 months)
- ✅ Complete import adapter overhaul (DONE)
- ⏳ UI modernization enabling advanced features
- ⏳ 2-3 high-priority features implemented
- ⏳ Plugin ecosystem foundation

### Medium-term Goals (6-12 months)
- ⏳ 5+ community plugins available
- ⏳ Full CI/CD integration suite
- ⏳ Enterprise collaboration features
- ⏳ Multi-protocol support (GraphQL, gRPC)

### Long-term Vision (1-2 years)
- ⏳ Industry-standard API testing platform
- ⏳ Comprehensive microservices testing suite
- ⏳ Thriving plugin ecosystem
- ⏳ Enterprise-grade collaboration tools

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **UI Modernization Complexity**: Start with progressive enhancement (HTMX) before full SPA
- **Plugin Security**: Sandboxed execution environment mandatory
- **Performance**: Careful optimization for large test suites

### Business Risks  
- **Feature Creep**: Strict prioritization and phased rollout
- **Community Adoption**: Focus on developer experience and integrations
- **Competition**: Differentiate through import capabilities and extensibility
