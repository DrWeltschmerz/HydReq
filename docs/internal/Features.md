# Proposed Features for HydReq

This document contains detailed descriptions of proposed new features for HydReq, an API testing tool. These features are suggested based on a comprehensive analysis of the repository, including code structure, existing functionality, documentation, and user-facing capabilities. Each feature includes rationale, implementation details, benefits, and potential challenges.

## Top Priority Features ✅ COMPLETED

### Enhanced Adapters + New Adapters: Full-Featured Importers for All Formats

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED in v0.3.4-beta
**Rationale:**
HydReq's import adapters are currently barebones, only handling basic request conversion. Comprehensive importers are crucial for adoption, allowing seamless migration from popular API tools while preserving complex configurations, auth, and test logic.

- **Note**: Playwright API tests are code-based (JS/TS) with complex logic, making conversion extremely challenging - likely not feasible for reliable import
- **Full Features**: Convert auth methods, environment variables, pre/post scripts to HydReq hooks/assertions, form-data/multipart bodies, folder structures, security schemes

**Implementation Details:**
- Extend all adapter packages with complete spec parsing
- Implement script conversion (JavaScript subset to HydReq equivalents)
- Add environment/variable mapping systems
- CLI import commands with customization options
