- Editor: visual tabs (suite, request, assert, extract, retry, matrix, openApi, hooks), YAML tab with two‑way sync, validation, quick run.
- Quick Run: run selected test with options (with deps, with previous stages), inspect messages.
- Batch run: select suites and run; track stage progress and per-test outcomes; download JSON/JUnit/HTML.
