# HydReq Web UI — Full Refactor Plan (2025-10-03)

This is the authoritative snapshot of the Web UI refactor plan. It reflects the full current state across JS/HTML/CSS, codestyle conventions, known pain points, and a step-by-step roadmap. Earlier notes remain below for history.

## Guiding principles

- Store-first state: `hydreqStore` is the source of truth for test/suite results; views subscribe/hydrate from it.
- One path for propagation: centralize status/badge/detail updates to prevent desync and race conditions.
- Small modules, clear boundaries: keep orchestrators thin (suites.js, editor.js) and delegate.
- Human-readable assets: no long lines, minimal inline styles, semantic classes/tokens.
- Zero-build by default; optional Vite/TypeScript build can coexist later.

## Current inventory (full sweep)

- HTML
  - `internal/webui/static/index.html` (app shell, loads CSS/JS)
  - `internal/webui/static/test-run-listener.html` (listener harness)
- CSS
  - `internal/webui/static/themes.css`, `layout.css`, `components.css`, `editor.css`, `css/app.css`
- App JS
  - `js/app.js`, `js/utils.js`
  - State: `js/state/store.js`, `js/state/tags.js`, `js/state/env.js`
  - Runs/SSE: `js/run.js`, `js/run-listener.js`, `js/suites-sse.js`
  - Suites: `js/suites-view.js`, `js/suites-actions.js`, `js/suites-dom.js`, `js/suites-state.js`, `js/suites-api.js`, `js/suites.js`
- Editor JS
  - `js/editor.js` (orchestrator), `js/editor/modal.js`, `js/editor/state.js`
  - YAML: `js/editor/yaml.js`, `js/editor/yaml-control.js`, `js/editor/serialize.js`
  - Forms: `js/editor/forms/*` (suite, testmeta, request, assert, retry, hooks, matrix, openapi)
  - Run: `js/editor/run.js`, `js/editor/run-ui.js`, `js/editor/run-records.js`
  - Other: `js/editor/normalize.js`, `js/editor/collect.js`, `js/editor/collapse.js`, `js/editor/tests-list.js`, `js/editor/issues.js`, `js/editor/validation.js`, `js/editor/tables.js`, `js/editor/utils.js`, `js/editor/init-helpers.js`

## Conventions and codestyle

- Formatting and readability
  - Max line length: ~100 columns (soft). Wrap arguments/attributes across lines.
  - Indentation: 2 spaces; no tabs. Keep trailing whitespace out.
  - One statement per line; keep functions small (aim <40 lines); extract helpers early.
  - Prefer early returns over nested conditionals; avoid deep nesting (>3 levels).
  - Keep import/script/link tags one per line in HTML head.

- Naming
  - JS variables/functions: `camelCase`. Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` only when truly constant.
  - Module exports: namespace under `window.hydreq*` (e.g., `window.hydreqEditorRunRecords`).
  - CSS classes/tokens: `kebab-case`. CSS custom props (tokens): `--token-name` and grouped by domain (e.g., `--input-bg`).
  - DOM ids stable, descriptive (e.g., `#ed_quickrun`, `#suiteBar`). Avoid generic names.

- Comments and docs
  - Each module: brief header comment with purpose and public API contract.
  - Non-obvious logic: short inline comments. Avoid noisy comments for obvious code.

- CSS and tokens
  - Themes: tokens live in `themes.css` only; `app.css` has no variables.
  - Badge tokens/classes: `status-badge` + `status-ok/fail/skip/unknown` with icons ✓ ✗ ○ ·.
  - No inline styles in JS; use utilities from `components.css`/`layout.css` and semantic classes.
  - Selector depth: avoid >3 levels; prefer class names over long descendant chains.

- Events and state
  - Normalize statuses to lowercase; map dependency-caused failures → `skipped` in one place (run-records).
  - Custom events use `hydreq:*` namespace (e.g., `hydreq:editor:test:update`).
  - Store-first: write to `hydreqStore` before patching DOM; views hydrate and subscribe.

- Error handling and logging
  - Guard try/catch to smallest scope; avoid swallowing errors silently—log with context in dev.
  - Keep debug logging behind a simple flag or use concise messages; remove noisy logs in production paths.

- Accessibility (A11y)
  - Use `aria-controls`, `aria-expanded`, and descriptive `title`/`aria-label` for interactive elements.
  - Ensure focus outlines are visible; keyboard navigation works for expand/collapse.
  - Details/summary used for collapsible sections with clear summary labels.

- Security
  - Avoid `innerHTML` for untrusted content; use `textContent` or safe templating.
  - Never interpolate untrusted values into event handlers or URLs without encoding.

- Performance
  - Batch DOM writes when patching many nodes; avoid layout thrash.
  - Prefer class toggles over repeated style mutations; debounce expensive handlers.

- Tooling (optional, no-build path preserved)
  - `.editorconfig` aligned with these rules (2 spaces, LF, UTF-8).
  - If linting is added later, codify the above via ESLint/Prettier configs without enforcing a build step.

## Recent decisions (2025-10-03 → 2025-10-04)

- Editor clean-slate by default; persistence opt-in via `localStorage['hydreq.editor.persistRuns']='1'`.
- Preserve prefill from suites view/store on editor open; immediate test-list render of badges.
- Centralized propagation in `editor/run-records.js` plus `hydreq:editor:test:update` events; removed duplicate paths from handlers.
 - Extract/Hook regression fixes:
   - Extract: `editor.js` now uses `window.hydreqEditorTables.extractTable` for rendering and round-tripping mappings.
   - Hooks: `forms/hooks.js` switched to namespaced `kvTable`; added empty-state toggling and deletion behavior; hook run uses centralized editor state for working/selIndex.
 - SSE syntax error fix: `run-listener.js` header comment corrected to avoid parse error on page load.
 - OpenAPI panel regression fix:
   - Root cause: After modal refactor, the OpenAPI details panel was correctly built, but the form module did not enforce visibility, and some flows left the form under a hidden state. The `wire` function also did not ensure the `<details>` was open when wiring.
   - Fix: In `forms/openapi.js`, ensure `#ed_oapi_form` has `.hidden` removed and its ancestor `<details>` is open during wiring; keep select value synced to `test.openApi.enabled`. Added unit test `editor-openapi.spec.js` to assert presence, visibility, and correct value.
  - Also removed misleading `tight` class from OpenAPI and Matrix panels in `editor/modal.js` as it caused them to become visually collapsed/invisible under some styles; added `editor-matrix.spec.js` to assert Matrix panel visibility.

## Pain points (scan highlights)

- Inline style usage — largely removed
  - Replaced remaining `.style.*` hotspots with classes/utilities where practical.
  - suites progress bars now use `setBar()`; initial width is handled by CSS.
  - Editor new-file banner uses badge classes instead of background/color/margin styles.
  - Validation UI uses class tokens (`text-error`, `border-red-500`, etc.) instead of inline colors.
  - Test harness feedback uses `text-success`/`text-error` classes.
  - Note: Any future style tweaks should be implemented as classes in `components.css`/`editor.css`.

- innerHTML usage
  - Widespread for clearing/rebuilding containers (tests/issues/tables) and injecting small HTML snippets.
  - Risk: future unsafe content and layout thrash. Prefer `textContent` + element builders.

- Console noise and error handling
  - Many `console.error/warn` calls in editor and suites paths. Keep minimal/guarded logs and scoped try/catch.

- A11y gaps
  - Aria present in suites expand/edit/delete, but editor buttons and some details lack explicit aria/labels.

- Orchestrator size / nesting
  - `suites.js` contains runner log + handlers; `editor.js` still wires `renderForm()` with large sections.

- State layering
  - Legacy `suites-state` overlaps `hydreqStore`; both updated in places.

- Selector sprawl
  - Repeated `querySelector` paths; fragile when structure changes.

- Limited unit tests / typings
  - Few targeted tests for run-records normalization and event-driven refresh; no TS contracts for events.

## Roadmap (step-by-step)

Phase A: Hygiene
- Replace inline styles with classes/utilities; add helpers to toggle classes (show/hide/flex/menu-open).
- Replace `innerHTML`-based rebuilds with element builders where feasible; keep safe and incremental updates.
- Centralize common selectors (new `editor/dom.js`, expand `suites-dom`); reduce deep descendant selectors.
- Reduce console noise: gate debug logs; ensure errors are actionable and scoped.
- Add missing aria-labels/titles to editor actions; confirm keyboard nav across details/summary and controls.

Status 2025-10-04:
- Completed: Eliminated remaining innerHTML clears in app/suites/utils; modal refactor to DOM builders; hooks.js hygiene; replaced inline styles in editor banner, suites stage progress, validation UI, and test harness.
- Remaining: A few legacy `.style.*` usages may still exist in rarely-hit branches; schedule follow-up sweep with grep and targeted fixes.

Phase B: Editor slimming
- Extract `editor/render-form.js`; remove test-only fallbacks from orchestrator; add minimal unit tests.

Status 2025-10-04 (update):
- Extracted `editor/render-form.js` and delegated from `editor.js`; added `editor-render-form.spec.js` to verify getters and selIndex re-wiring.
- A11y: added label/for mappings for key inputs and aria-labels for collapse/toggle controls; set progressbar aria attributes in `utils.setBar`.
- Added targeted unit tests beyond OpenAPI/Matrix:
  - `suites-dom-progress.spec.js` for stage progress and aria.
  - `run-records-badge.spec.js` for suite badge no-downgrade.
  - `editor-update-event.spec.js` for re-render on `hydreq:editor:test:update`.
  - `hooks-empty-extract.spec.js` for hooks empty-state and basic collect.

Remaining TODOs:
- Optional: add stricter hooks extract round-trip tests (jsdom quirks tolerated).
- Optional: expand store-first badge hydration tests after page refresh.

Phase C: Store-first consolidation
- Ensure all UI updates follow store writes; reduce reliance on legacy `suites-state` to hydration-only.
- Document event shapes; enforce normalization in one module.

Phase D: CSS consistency and a11y
- Verify `.status-*` tokens everywhere; remove ad-hoc colors; add aria/labels where missing.

Phase E: Feature toggles
- Editor checkbox to toggle persistence (sets `hydreq.editor.persistRuns`).

Phase F: Tests
- Add jsdom tests for:
  - run-records normalization (dependency → skipped)
  - editor refresh on `hydreq:editor:test:update`
  - suites-dom show/hide helpers toggle classes (no inline styles)
  - element builders produce safe textContent (no unsafe innerHTML paths)
- E2E: suite expand/hydration, DAG single-stage, batch progress, editor quick-run.

Phase G: Build opt-in and Svelte islands
- Add Vite build to `static/dist/`; convert store/contracts to TS.
- Identify Svelte islands (suites list, editor panes) and create adapters to store; migrate incrementally.

## Acceptance criteria

- No inline-style hotspots; utility classes used. (most addressed; minor follow-ups noted)
- Editor orchestrator < ~500 lines; forms wiring fully extracted. (in progress—slimmed with render-form extraction)
- Single propagation path with store-first semantics; dependsOn skip normalization covered by tests.
- Consistent tokens for badges/message blocks across views.
- Optional build coexists with zero-build path.

## Operational notes

- Enable editor run persistence: `localStorage.setItem('hydreq.editor.persistRuns','1')`
- Disable: `localStorage.removeItem('hydreq.editor.persistRuns')`

---

## Theme Split Summary
- All theme variable blocks moved from `themes.css` into individual files under `static/themes/`:
  - `base.css` (`:root`)
  - `dark.css` (`body.dark`)
  - `hack.css` (`body.hack`)
  - `catppuccin-mocha.css`, `catppuccin-latte.css`, `synthwave.css`, etc.
- `themes.css` now aggregates via `@import`.
- `app.css` only contains rules, not theme variables.
- Theme selector in `index.html` matches available themes.

## Conventions
- Add new themes by creating a file in `static/themes/` and adding an `@import` in `themes.css`.
- Theme variables must be scoped to either `:root` or `body.<theme>`.
- No duplication of theme variables in other CSS files.
- Theme selector options must match available theme files.
- Use class-based switching via `applyTheme()` in JS.

## Next Steps
- Expand theme support as needed (add more theme files).
- Optionally document theme tokens in `docs/web-ui.md`.
- Continue JS refactor: split large files, add tests for store and theme switching.

## Gaps and cleanup plan (Phase 0/1 follow-up)

Observations
# Web UI refactor plan

This plan proposes a pragmatic refactor of HydReq's Web UI to improve maintainability, reduce duplication, and keep current functionality intact.

## Goals

- Reduce duplication (single source for utilities, themes, and suites logic).
- Split monoliths into small modules with clear boundaries.
- Maintain zero-build development workflow initially; allow optional bundling later.
- Preserve existing URLs and DOM IDs to avoid backend changes.

## Options considered

1) Vanilla JS + HTMX/Alpine (no build or minimal build)
   - Pros: small surface, easy to adopt incrementally, keeps SSR/simple hosting.
   - Cons: Still global-by-default; SSE management remains custom.

2) Preact + htm + Vite + TypeScript
   - Pros: Strong component model, small runtime, typed contracts, CodeMirror integrations exist.
   - Cons: Introduces a dev build; more moving parts.

3) React/Vue/Svelte SPA
   - Pros: Rich ecosystem, routing, state mgmt.
   - Cons: Bigger footprint; larger migration and infra for bundles.

Recommendation: Option 2 (Preact + htm + Vite + TS) for the editor and suites components, but proceed in phases to keep current UI working during migration. Start with Option 1 patterns (modular vanilla) to re-establish boundaries, then pave the path to Preact as needed.

## Phased migration

  - Keep CSS/JS human-readable: prefer multiple short lines over single long lines.
  - Avoid excessive inline styles in JS. Prefer semantic classes and tokens.
  - Preserve indentation and spacing for diffs; wrap text where sensible.

Phase 0: Housekeeping (no behavior changes)
Central store usage
- hydreqStore is the single source of truth for suite/test state across views (suites list, runner log, editor quick-run).
- UI subscribes to store updates and patches in-place; hydration occurs on expand to avoid stale views.
- Badge/status classes are derived in a single place; components do not compute divergent logic.
- TODO: Add JS unit tests to cover store semantics (setTest, setSummary, derived badge) and subscription delivery.
- Remove dead/legacy files after verification: `internal/webui/static/suites.js`, `internal/webui/static/js/helpers.js`. (done)
- Move index.html inline `<style>` to `css/app.css`. (done)
- Consolidate theme tokens into `themes.css` and reference from `app.css`. (done — theme tokens have been moved to `themes.css` and `app.css` now references `themes.css` as the primary source for variables.)

Phase 1: Module boundaries (completed)
- Create `js/state/` with small modules:
  - `tags.js`: get/set, events, persistence. (done)
  - `env.js`: kv model + render mirroring. (done)
  - `run.js`: start/cancel run, SSE subscribe, event shapes. (done)
- Extract SSE listener from `js/suites.js` into `js/run-listener.js` with callbacks. (done — run-listener.subscribe now parses SSE and awaits async handlers; suites.js delegates to it and retains a fallback EventSource for compatibility.)
- Extract suites rendering into `js/suites-view.js`; keep the DOM IDs stable. (done)
- Extract user actions from `suites.js` to `js/suites-actions.js` (expand/collapse, new suite, import). (done)
- Extract DOM builders into `js/suites-dom.js` (test rows, header tags/env, stage rows, badge and details helpers). (done)
- Extract SSE wrapper into `js/suites-sse.js` and delegate from `listen()`. (done)
- Add `suites-api.js` with stable window-facing helpers; move remaining helpers from `suites.js` to shrink file size; keep back-compat stubs. (done)
- Add small DOM utilities (setFlexRow/Col, show/hide, buildDownloadMenu) to reduce inline styles and long lines. (done)
- Add server helper `POST /api/editor/checkpath` to validate client-proposed paths and report existence/safety. (done — supports the improved "New Suite" UX.)
- New Suite UX: promptNewSuite now uses server-side check and opens the editor in "create" mode when the target file does not exist; the editor now shows a clear "New suite" banner, uses "Create" button labels, re-validates and asks to confirm on overwrite/validation warnings. (done)
- Suite list details: Display test failure details below the test name, in a collapsed-by-default details/summary element with a scrollable, copy-friendly message block. (done)
- Editor details styling: Unified scrollable message block across quick-run and per-test details. (done)

Acceptance: suites list renders; SSE updates badges/progress as before; editor opens; quick-run works; New Suite flow presents a safer, validated create path; test details display clearly underneath the test name; suite list failure details are collapsed by default and expand on demand; message blocks are scrollable and easy to copy. Unit tests cover run-listener, suites-dom helpers, suites-sse wrapper, and suites-api hydration.

Additional (2025-10-04 updates):
- utils.js renderActiveEnv now avoids innerHTML for clearing; uses safe child removal.
- Expanded unit tests: suite badge re-hydration, env state read/render, suites-state basics, assert form wiring, and editor validation helpers.

Note on componentization path (user-preferred)
- Consider Svelte + Vite + Tailwind (+ DaisyUI) + CodeMirror for component-based architecture. Keep current zero-build path running in parallel during migration.
- Hosting remains via Go static file server; Vite build outputs to `internal/webui/static/dist/` and index.html can conditionally load built assets.

Phase 2: Editor split (in progress)
- Split `js/editor.js` into submodules:
  - `editor/modal.js` (shell, open/close, density).
  - `editor/state.js` (normalize, working model, dirty tracking).
  - `editor/yaml.js` (CodeMirror setup, serialize/parse, theme sync).
  - `editor/forms/*.js` (suite, test, request, assert, retry, hooks, matrix, openapi).
  - `editor/run.js` (quick-run, SSE, badge propagation).
  - `editor/controls.js` (delegated run/validate/save; accepts a compact
    context object from editor.js to keep editor.js lean).
  - `editor/validation.js` (field validation helpers and wiring). [added]
  - `editor/run-ui.js` (quick-run UI preparation and event handlers). [added]
  - `editor/normalize.js` (pure normalization from parsed suite → working model). [added]
  - `editor/run-records.js` (quick-run record caching, per-test/suite badges, LS persistence). [added]
  - `editor/collapse.js` (column collapse wiring for tests/visual/yaml/results). [added]
  - `editor/utils.js` now owns a shared `debounce()`; removed local duplicates from `editor.js`. [updated]
  - Add minimal unit tests for editor modal open/close and state changes.
   - New tests: `editor-dirty-suppression.spec.js` verifies that programmatic
     `setText+baseline` does not mark the editor dirty after save; also kept
     editor save tests working via local fallbacks when `controls.js` is not
     loaded in isolated jsdom runs.
- Keep a thin `editor/index.js` that stitches modules and exposes the same `openEditor()` API.

Acceptance: 4-column editor remains functional with real-time YAML sync; quick-run + validate OK; deletes update YAML and suites.

Notes on whitespace and readability
- Wrapped long lines across new modules to keep code readable and diffs friendly.
- Replaced inline style mutations with CSS classes where practical; remaining instances are TODO for Phase 0/1 follow-up.
- Removed duplicate helpers (local debounce/setVisualEnabled) in `editor.js`; rely on single implementations.
 - Extracted quick-run records and badge logic out of `editor.js` into `editor/run-records.js`; editor now delegates via a small adapter.
 - Extracted column collapse logic into `editor/collapse.js` and referenced it from `index.html`.
 - Delegated button handlers to `editor/controls.js`. Editor exposes a
   minimal context (getWorking, getSelIndex, getYamlText, getPath,
   collectFormData, serializeWorkingToYamlImmediate, quick-run helpers,
   dirty/close accessors). This keeps the orchestrator short.
 - Fixed post-save dirty flicker by introducing a brief suppression window
   around programmatic YAML updates (setText/baseline). `yaml.js` ignores
   change events until the window elapses. `yaml-control.js` sets the window
   on programmatic writes.
 - Provided local fallbacks for validate/save in `editor.js` so tests that
   load only `editor.js` still pass without pulling in `controls.js`.
 - Next: remove test fallbacks from `editor.js` and keep them in test-only
 - Removed inline fallbacks for matrix and hooks; rely on `forms/matrix.js`
   and `forms/hooks.js`. Provide minimal no-op getters when modules are not
   loaded (tests) without bloating the orchestrator.
 - Extracted `normalizeParsed` into `editor/normalize.js` and wired via
   `window.hydreqEditorNormalize.normalize`.
 - Fixed left column vertical fill by CSS-only changes (flex/min-height on
   `.ed-col`, `.ed-col-content`, `.ed-tests-panel`, `.ed-tests-list`).

Phase 3: TypeScript & build opt-in
- Adopt TypeScript gradually for new modules (state/contracts). Configure Vite for dev build that outputs to `internal/webui/static/dist/`.
- Keep current non-bundled files working; allow index.html to switch to `dist/` when present via `<script type="module">`.

Phase 4: Preact islands (optional)
- Wrap suites list and editor panes as Preact components, mounted into existing DOM anchors. Migrate state to TS modules.

## Contracts and data shapes

- SSE events:
  - batchStart { total }
  - suiteStart { name, path, total, stages: { [stage:string]: count } }
  - testStart { Name, Stage, path }
  - test { Name, Status, DurationMs, Stage, Messages, path }
  - suiteEnd { name, path, summary, tests? }
  - batchEnd, done, error
- Editor run API: POST /api/editor/testrun { parsed, env, runAll, testIndex?, includeDeps, includePrevStages }
- Save API: POST /api/editor/save { path, content }

## Testing strategy

- Keep Playwright/E2E focused on:
  - Suites list render and expand
  - Stage rows and progress for dependsOn = single stage 0
  - Badge propagation from SSE and editor quick-run
  - Tag chip ↔ checkbox sync
  - Env pills mirrored in header and aside
- Unit tests (small): factor logic (tags/env state) into pure functions. (in-progress — adding Node-based unit tests using Mocha + JSDOM under internal/webui/static/test to validate run-listener and suites flush behavior.)

### E2E framework choice: Cypress vs Playwright

Context
- Repo contains `Dockerfile.playwright`, and we already use `docker-compose.playwright.yml` for local stacks. Our UI is server-rendered/static assets with SSE.

Comparison (focused on our needs)
- Cross-browser: Playwright ships WebKit/Firefox/Chromium out-of-the-box; Cypress relies on the system browser (Chromium-family strongest). Playwright wins for breadth (useful if we want Safari/WebKit sanity checks).
- SSE support and network control: Both can assert UI effects; Playwright has strong network mocking and event listeners. SSE is best validated via UI assertions; both are fine, but Playwright’s waiting and event primitives are a bit cleaner.
- Parallelism and retries: Both support; Playwright’s sharding/retries are first-class and simple to wire in CI.
- Headless containerization: Playwright publishes maintained images (already referenced by our Dockerfile). Cypress also has images, but given our existing Playwright setup, Playwright integrates faster.
- API testing overlap: We already test backend in Go; UI E2E should focus on DOM interactions and SSE-driven updates. Either works; Playwright’s fixtures/page model align well with our minimal build setup.

Recommendation
- Use Playwright for E2E. Rationale: repo already includes Playwright Dockerfile; cross-browser coverage; robust CI story; minimal additional tooling.

Initial E2E scenarios
- Suites list: render list, expand a suite, verify test rows and details collapse/expand.
- Batch run: simulate or run a small suite; assert stage counters and progress; badge updates.
- Editor quick-run: open editor for a fixture; run a test; assert badge and messages appear.
- Tag/env filters: toggle tag chips; verify filter affects displayed tests; env pills mirrored in header.

## Risks and mitigations

- Drift between runner view and editor quick-run badges
  - Mitigate by centralizing status map in a single module and use events to sync.
- CSS theming drift
  - Single source of tokens and scoped classnames for editor vs runner.
- Bundle introduction friction
  - Keep no-build path working; gate new modules behind optional `<script type="module">` when built files exist.

## Done criteria for refactor

- No duplicate JS helpers; no dead files. (done)
- index.html has no inline styles; all CSS under `css/` or `editor.css`. (done)
- Themes defined once; editor and runner share tokens. (done)
- Suites and editor code split into modules; file sizes manageable (<500 lines typical per module). (partially done - Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 in progress)
- All previously fixed correctness issues (dependsOn single-stage, batch counters, suite badge stability, path-filtered events) remain green. (done)
- Run-listener robustness: add reconnection/backoff with exponential delay and unit tests. (done — subscribe() now reconnects with capped backoff and stops on unsubscribe; tests under internal/webui/static/test/*reconnect*.spec.js)
- Test details UX improvement: display details on a separate line underneath the test name. (done)
- Automated E2E tests for UI interactions and rendering. (in progress)

## Gaps and cleanup plan (Phase 0/1 follow-up)

Observations
- Some JS files remain large (e.g., `internal/webui/static/js/suites.js`, `editor.js`).
- A few inline style assignments are still present in JS (layout/margins), should be moved to CSS classes.
- Styles are largely centralized, but we still set ad-hoc style props (e.g., badge background colors) that should be expressed as classes/tokens.

Plan
0) Whitespace and readability policy
  - Keep CSS/JS human-readable: prefer multiple short lines over single long lines.
  - Avoid excessive inline styles in JS. Prefer semantic classes and tokens.
  - Preserve indentation and spacing for diffs; wrap text where sensible.
  - Theme variables formatted one per line; JS DOM builders avoid long chained statements.
1) Inline styles → CSS classes
  - Create utility classes in `app.css` for row spacing, padding, hover, and badge states.
  - Replace remaining `el.style.*` in `suites-view.js` and `suites.js` with class names.
  - Acceptance: grep shows zero remaining marginLeft/fontSize/position hot spots in UI JS (excluding tests).
2) Split large JS files
  - `suites.js`: extract `sse-handlers.js` (listen/handlers), `suite-state.js` (selection, lastStatus, buffering), `suite-dom.js` (DOM builders), keeping a thin orchestrator.
  - In progress: Extracted `suites-actions.js`. Next: move header renderers (renderHeaderTags/env) and store wiring to `suite-state.js`.
  - `editor.js`: continue Phase 2 split (modal, state, yaml, forms/*, run).
3) Status/badge CSS tokens (done)
  - Added unified classes: `.status-badge`, `.status-ok`, `.status-fail`, `.status-skip`, `.status-unknown`.
  - Replaced inline style updates across suites and editor with class-based updates and standardized icons: ✓ passed, ✗ failed, ○ skipped, · unknown.
4) Store-first state and buffering (done)
  - Introduced `hydreqStore` as a small central store for suite/test results with pub/sub.
  - Removed legacy pending buffers and the `flushPendingForPath` path from suites; rely on hydration from store when expanding suites, and on store subscription for incremental updates.
4) Tests
  - Add E2E for suite expand and details collapse/expand; verify scrollability and copy behavior.
5) Docs
  - Keep this plan and Summary of findings in sync; link classes and modules as they land.

CSS de-duplication (Phase 2 adjunct)
- Moved editor-specific rules from `css/app.css` into `editor.css`, including:
  - Compact field widths, checkbox alignment, form grid gaps, density toggles
  - Modal layout, CodeMirror skin, splitter hover, hook/matrix styles
  - message-block shared component (used by editor and suites)
- Namespaced editor selectors under `#editorModal` to avoid app.css overrides.
- Kept app.css focused on app-wide layout and suites/runner styles.

## 2025-10-03 snapshot: Editor state and run propagation stabilization

Decisions and changes

- Clean-slate editor by default
  - The editor no longer restores run state from browser localStorage on load unless explicitly enabled via a preference.
  - Preference key: `hydreq.editor.persistRuns`
    - Default: not set (clean slate)
    - Opt-in persistence: set to `'1'` to enable run-state persistence between sessions.
  - Affects:
    - `editor/run-records.js`: `getRunRecord`, `saveRunRecord`, and LS writes are gated by the preference.
    - `editor.js`: pre-seed from LS only when the preference is on.

- Preserve prefill from suites view/store
  - On editor open, we still hydrate from current suites data (store/summary) so badges/details appear immediately even without LS persistence.
  - `editor.js` now re-renders tests immediately after this hydration to display status badges.

- Centralized propagation and normalization
  - Status propagation is centralized in `editor/run-records.js` to avoid duplicate and out-of-order DOM updates.
  - New normalization: dependency-caused failures (messages starting with `"dependency ..."`) are mapped to `skipped`.
  - Emitted event `hydreq:editor:test:update` keeps the editor view refreshed, avoiding stale badges/details.
  - Removed duplicate suites view updates from `editor/run-ui.js` and redundant paths in `editor.js`.

- Suites details rules
  - Suites view only renders details for `failed` and `skipped` (skipped only when messages exist), keeping noise low.

- Quality gates
  - Build: PASS
  - Tests: PASS

Progress estimate (overall refactor): ~82–85%
- Phase 1 (module boundaries): done.
- Phase 2 (editor split): largely done—core splits complete; remaining: a few unit tests and minor orchestrator trimming.
- Hygiene and a11y: substantially improved; a few inline style hotspots remain by design (progress width), now centralized and annotated for future CSS-based approach.

Current pain points (observed)

- Some inline style mutations remain; continue migrating to CSS classes/tokens.
- `editor.js` still hosts `renderForm()` orchestration; needs extraction to `editor/render-form.js`.
- State duplication risk between legacy suites-state and new `hydreqStore`; consolidation or clear layering required.
- Long DOM queries and scattered selectors; consider centralizing selectors and DOM helpers further.
- Limited JS unit tests for editor/run-records and event-driven refresh.
- No TypeScript types for state/contracts; difficult to reason about event shapes at scale.

Next milestones (near-term)

1) Extract `editor/render-form.js` and shrink `editor.js` further.
2) Add targeted unit tests:
   - run-records status normalization (dependsOn → skipped)
   - event-driven editor refresh (tests list re-render on `hydreq:editor:test:update`)
3) Unify store-first flows and reduce reliance on legacy suites-state (ensure single source of truth).
4) Optional UI toggle in editor header for "Remember last run state" (tied to `hydreq.editor.persistRuns`).
5) Continue CSS cleanup: remove remaining inline style usages; ensure class-based tokens are used.

Svelte migration path (future-oriented)

- Identify islands:
  - Suites list (badge/details rendering, expand/collapse)
  - Editor columns (tests list, quick-run, YAML pane)
- Migrate store/contracts to TypeScript; expose a small adapter to Svelte components.
- Introduce Vite build that outputs to `internal/webui/static/dist/` while retaining zero-build fallback.
- Incrementally rewrite islands in Svelte; keep DOM IDs/anchors stable to coexist during migration.

How to enable/disable editor run persistence

- Enable (opt-in):
  - In browser console: `localStorage.setItem('hydreq.editor.persistRuns','1')`
- Disable (default clean slate):
  - `localStorage.removeItem('hydreq.editor.persistRuns')`
