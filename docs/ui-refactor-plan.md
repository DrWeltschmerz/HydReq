# Web UI refactor plan

This plan proposes a pragmatic refactor of HydReq's Web UI to improve maintainability, reduce duplication, and keep current functionality intact.

## Goals

- Reduce duplication (single source for utilities, themes, and suites logic).
- Split monoliths into small modules with clear boundaries.
- Maintain zero-build development workflow initially; allow optional bundling later.
- Preserve existing URLs and DOM IDs to avoid backend changes.

## Options considered

1) Vanilla JS + HTMX/Alpine (no build or minimal build)
   - Pros: small surface, easy to adopt incrementally, keeps SSR/simple hosting.
   - Cons: Still global-by-default; SSE management remains custom.

2) Preact + htm + Vite + TypeScript
   - Pros: Strong component model, small runtime, typed contracts, CodeMirror integrations exist.
   - Cons: Introduces a dev build; more moving parts.

3) React/Vue/Svelte SPA
   - Pros: Rich ecosystem, routing, state mgmt.
   - Cons: Bigger footprint; larger migration and infra for bundles.

Recommendation: Option 2 (Preact + htm + Vite + TS) for the editor and suites components, but proceed in phases to keep current UI working during migration. Start with Option 1 patterns (modular vanilla) to re-establish boundaries, then pave the path to Preact as needed.

## Phased migration

Phase 0: Housekeeping (no behavior changes)
- Remove dead/legacy files after verification: `internal/webui/static/suites.js`, `internal/webui/static/js/helpers.js`.
- Move index.html inline `<style>` to `css/app.css`.
- Consolidate theme tokens into `themes.css` and reference from `app.css`.

Phase 1: Module boundaries
- Create `js/state/` with small modules:
  - `tags.js`: get/set, events, persistence.
  - `env.js`: kv model + render mirroring.
  - `run.js`: start/cancel run, SSE subscribe, event shapes.
- Extract SSE listener from `js/suites.js` into `js/run-listener.js` with callbacks.
- Extract suites rendering into `js/suites-view.js`; keep the DOM IDs stable.

Acceptance: suites list renders; SSE updates badges/progress as before; editor opens; quick-run works.

Phase 2: Editor split
- Split `js/editor.js` into submodules:
  - `editor/modal.js` (shell, open/close, density).
  - `editor/state.js` (normalize, working model, dirty tracking).
  - `editor/yaml.js` (CodeMirror setup, serialize/parse, theme sync).
  - `editor/forms/*.js` (suite, test, request, assert, retry, hooks, matrix, openapi).
  - `editor/run.js` (quick-run, SSE, badge propagation).
- Keep a thin `editor/index.js` that stitches modules and exposes the same `openEditor()` API.

Acceptance: 4-column editor remains functional with real-time YAML sync; quick-run + validate OK; deletes update YAML and suites.

Phase 3: TypeScript & build opt-in
- Adopt TypeScript gradually for new modules (state/contracts). Configure Vite for dev build that outputs to `internal/webui/static/dist/`.
- Keep current non-bundled files working; allow index.html to switch to `dist/` when present via `<script type="module">`.

Phase 4: Preact islands (optional)
- Wrap suites list and editor panes as Preact components, mounted into existing DOM anchors. Migrate state to TS modules.

## Contracts and data shapes

- SSE events:
  - batchStart { total }
  - suiteStart { name, path, total, stages: { [stage:string]: count } }
  - testStart { Name, Stage, path }
  - test { Name, Status, DurationMs, Stage, Messages, path }
  - suiteEnd { name, path, summary, tests? }
  - batchEnd, done, error
- Editor run API: POST /api/editor/testrun { parsed, env, runAll, testIndex?, includeDeps, includePrevStages }
- Save API: POST /api/editor/save { path, content }

## Testing strategy

- Keep Playwright/E2E focused on:
  - Suites list render and expand
  - Stage rows and progress for dependsOn = single stage 0
  - Badge propagation from SSE and editor quick-run
  - Tag chip â†” checkbox sync
  - Env pills mirrored in header and aside
- Unit tests (small): factor logic (tags/env state) into pure functions.

## Risks and mitigations

- Drift between runner view and editor quick-run badges
  - Mitigate by centralizing status map in a single module and use events to sync.
- CSS theming drift
  - Single source of tokens and scoped classnames for editor vs runner.
- Bundle introduction friction
  - Keep no-build path working; gate new modules behind optional `<script type="module">` when built files exist.

## Done criteria for refactor

- No duplicate JS helpers; no dead files.
- index.html has no inline styles; all CSS under `css/` or `editor.css`.
- Themes defined once; editor and runner share tokens.
- Suites and editor code split into modules; file sizes manageable (<500 lines typical per module).
- All previously fixed correctness issues (dependsOn single-stage, batch counters, suite badge stability, path-filtered events) remain green.
